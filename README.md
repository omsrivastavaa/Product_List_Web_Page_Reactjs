# Personal Products Web App

This project is a simple web app built using **React** to manage user authentication and product management. The application features a login page, a home page for managing products, and a search bar to filter the products.

## Features

- **Login Page**: Allows users to log in using email and password. 
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of added products with the ability to add new products and search/filter existing ones.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is handled through localStorage, ensuring users are redirected to the home page after logging in.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **CSS**: Custom styles for a modern UI
- **API**: Used **ReqRes API** for mock login functionality.
